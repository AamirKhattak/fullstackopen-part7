# PART 5 - Testing React apps

## (c) Resting React Apps

There are many different ways of testing React applications. Let's take a look at them next.

Tests will be implemented with the same [Jest](http://jestjs.io/) testing library developed by Facebook that was used in the previous part. Jest is actually configured by default to applications created with create-react-app.

In addition to Jest, we also need another testing library that will help us render components for testing purposes. The current best option for this is [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) which has seen rapid growth in popularity in recent times.
```
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```
[jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom/) that provides some nice Jest-related helper methods.



----------
## (a) Login in Frontend

- conditional rendering

```
      //If the first statement evaluates to false, or is falsy, the second statement (generating the form) is not executed at all.
      {user === null && loginForm()}
      {user !== null && noteForm()}
```

- sending user auth token with requests

```
const setToken = newToken => {
  token = `bearer ${newToken}`
}

const getAll = () => {
  const request = axios.get(baseUrl)
  return request.then(response => response.data)
}

const create = async newObject => {
  const config = {
    headers: { Authorization: token },
  }

  const response = await axios.post(baseUrl, newObject, config)
  return response.data
}
```

- Saving the token to the browser's local storage
  `window.localStorage.setItem( 'loggedNoteappUser', JSON.stringify(user) ) `
  `const loggedUserJSON = window.localStorage.getItem('loggedNoteappUser')`
  `window.localStorage.removeItem('loggedNoteappUser')`
  `window.localStorage.clear() //empties localstorage completely:`
- displaying notifications

## (b) props.children and proptypes

- conditional rendering, displaying forms when appropriate
- The components children, aka. **props.children**
  - Togglable Component

```
import { useState } from 'react'

const Togglable = (props) => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false)

  const hideWhenVisible = { display: visible ? 'none' : '' }
  const showWhenVisible = { display: visible ? '' : 'none' }

  const toggleVisibility = () => {
    setVisible(!visible)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={hideWhenVisible}>
        <button onClick={toggleVisibility}>{props.buttonLabel}</button>
      </div>
      <div style={showWhenVisible}>
        {props.children}
        <button onClick={toggleVisibility}>cancel</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Togglable
```

- References to components with ref
    - [useRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref), [forwardRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactforwardref), [useImperativeHandle](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useimperativehandle)
- PropTypes
```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

const Togglable = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  // ..
})

Togglable.propTypes = {
  buttonLabel: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
